# Terraform-AWS-Jenkins
This repository provides Terraform code to automate the deployment of a Jenkins environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provisions an EC2 instance, an RDS MySQL database, and an S3 bucket, and installs and configures Jenkins within the EC2 instance. The infrastructure can be easily created, modified, and destroyed using Terraform.
